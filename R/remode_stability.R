#' @description remode_stability evaluates the stability of the mode estimation of the remode() function
#' by performing jacknife resampling. It generates
#' a series of jackknife resamples, calculates the mean and most frequent number of modes for
#' each sample, and determines the stability of the original modality estimate.
#' Stability is determined by te maximum percentage of data removal for which the
#' majority of iterations still find the original number of modes.
#' Using the same logic, this method also checks the stability of estimated mode location.
#'
#' @param remode_result A list of class `remode_result`, output of remode() function
#' @param iterations Numeric value specifying the number of random sub-samples to generate for each percentage step. Default is 100.
#' @param percentage_steps An integer specifying the number of percentage steps for data removal. Default is 20 (i.e. steps of 5).
#' @param plot Logical value indicating wether to plot the results. Default is TRUE.
#'
#' @return A list containing the stability analysis results.
